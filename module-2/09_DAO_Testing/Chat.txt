	Good Morning!
09:24:12 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	Also, while loops are used when you don't know the total before you start the loop.  For instance, we don't know how many rows will be returned with a SQL query in a database.  If you somehow did know beforehand how many rows would come back, you could use a for loop (for the index)
09:24:31 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	Always use while
09:24:41 From  Kevin Steinbach, Java {he/him]  to  Everyone:

	the pandemic is a great excuse tho
10:09:07 From  Donny Sweeney Java (he/him)  to  Everyone:
	the only good thing its given us
10:19:18 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	System Under Test
10:22:21 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	It's a mouthful, in JdbcCityDao.java, the System Under Test (sut) is the Java Database Connectivity (Jdbc) City Data Access Object (Dao)
10:22:35 From  Elias Clark, Java, they/them  to  Everyone:
	so the sut is essentially the testing database object?
10:22:39 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	Clear as mud!
10:23:34 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	Yes.  Each Jdbc____Dao needs its own test.  The sut in each test is an instance of the Jdbc____Dao object.  It is stored in that private instance field under the generic name sut (system under test) for each test file
10:24:13 From  Elias Clark, Java, they/them  to  Everyone:
	üòµ‚Äçüí´
10:24:14 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	the Jdbc___Dao object is the object that actually does all things related to SQL queries for your database, and turns it into magic Java jibber jabber.  It is magic
10:24:28 From  Kieta Gatson, Java, She/Her  to  Everyone:
	brb
10:24:31 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	ü§™
10:25:22 From  Angel Scott, Java, she/her  to  Everyone:
	sut is essentially just the name FOR the jdbc object that gets created before each test correct?
10:26:14 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	Yes.  The Jdbc___Dao object represents a connection or system as a whole.  That is the system under test, therefore saved as sut
10:26:30 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	Two level stack (database to Java language)
10:26:36 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	No front end... yet
10:28:46 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	Front End	‚Üë   |	|    |	|    |	Java	|    |	|    ‚Üì	Database
10:29:51 From  Angel Scott, Java, she/her  to  Everyone:
	^^ The Fullstack
10:30:42 From  Danilo Pivaral-Alvarez  to  Everyone:
	The whole enchilada
10:30:44 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	üòÉüòÆ
10:31:38 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	These tests are therefore called Integration tests.  The java language is integrated with the PostgreSQL database.
10:31:53 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	Unlike Unit tests, which test individual working parts of the Java language
