# Student Code
###### (01/17/2022)

This repository, also known as a "repo", will be your working code for lectures, tutorials, and exercises. You will work locally on your code in here, then push it up to GitLab. After you run the setup.sh bash script, you will be able to download new code provided by your instructor by pulling it down from "upstream".
