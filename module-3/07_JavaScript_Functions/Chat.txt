09:59:50 From  Ben Langhinrichs (he/him)  to  Everyone:
	As an answer to Danilo, while Shift-Enter may work, you can also just use Enter if you have started a function or parameter list and not finished it. I have not used Shift Enter in lecture yet today.

	if (CONDITION {	    TRUE	} else {	    FLASE	}		--------------------------------------------------------------		(CONDITION) ? TRUE : FALSE;			Fancy short hand, top is if/else form, below the dotted line is called a ternary operator.  They both do the same thing just the ternary operator is syntactic sugar to make it one line
10:47:52 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	Ha! Flase haha
