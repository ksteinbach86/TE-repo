	So, in general, in your catch statements, always START the catch blocks (if you have multiple) with the MOST SPECIFIC Exception, and end the catch blocks with the MOST GENERAL Exception.		The specificity is dependent on how far down the inheritance chain the Exception is.  The Exception class is the most general (and therefore should be last if used at all)

	wait, it's all .txt files? 	always has been.
10:51:02 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	public interface AutoCloseable		An object that may hold resources (such as file or socket handles) until it is closed. The close() method of an AutoCloseable object is called automatically when exiting a try-with-resources block for which the object has been declared in the resource specification header. This construction ensures prompt release, avoiding resource exhaustion exceptions and errors that may otherwise occur.
