11:08:31 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	I put a definition in yesterday's chat for this:
11:08:32 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	Short circuit:  Having and error check on the left side of a Boolean && expression that will save us from having errors in the right side of the expression.  Ex:				if (myString != null && myString.length() == 5)
11:08:45 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	If the left hand of the && Boolean expression evaluates to false, the right half is ignored and does not need to be evaluated.  We have 'short circuited' a null pointer exception caused by myString.length(0 in the event myString = null
11:08:55 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	Null pointers cannot call methods.  REPEAT: Null pointers cannot call methods.  It will trigger a NULL POINTER EXCEPTION and you will have a bad time.
11:09:05 From  Jacob Chafin, Java, he/him  to  Everyone:
	That is a very helpful tool to have for me ^^
11:09:26 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	The only difference is Ben is using an || operator, but the point remains the same.
11:10:12 From  Angel Scott, Java, she/her  to  Everyone:
	Null pointers not being able to call methods explains why the first two on the homework due today gave me such a headache lol
11:10:17 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	Exactly
11:10:35 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	üôå
11:10:54 From  Jacob Chafin, Java, he/him  to  Everyone:
	üëê
11:11:59 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	The difference between reference types (pointers) and primitive types is HUGE! Have to know the difference like the back of your hand but it is not an easy concept to grasp without understanding a little about:		1. Memory allocation	2. Stack memory	3. Heap memory
11:12:36 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	A good picture will solve all of that ideally
11:23:37 From  Mikey Stewart, Java, he/him  to  Everyone:
	if anyone wants to zoom and go through old excerises and compare this weekend id love to
11:23:45 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	Sure
11:23:46 From  Mikey Stewart, Java, he/him  to  Everyone:
	i would never think to do that and its clever
11:25:04 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	There are actually infinitely many solutions to any single problem in computer science.  There is infinite 'noise', or arbitrary solution sets.  John Nash (A Beautiful Mind movie guy) talked a lot about that.  But that's well beside the point.  It's been a talking point about Computer Science for a long time.
11:26:00 From  Mikey Stewart, Java, he/him  to  Everyone:
	i love that about it. im the same as Jacob though where im just worried sometimes that what i came up with is bad form
11:26:16 From  Elias Clark, Java, they/them  to  Everyone:
	you can poach a hamburger if you need to, its gonna cook it. is it super easy to get it to not cook correctly and not the preferred method? nope, but I mean, it depends on how often youre gonna use the burger n whatnot
11:26:46 From  Elias Clark, Java, they/them  to  Everyone:
	^* super easy to ruin it and not the preferred method = yes lol sorry brain tired
11:27:15 From  Mikey Stewart, Java, he/him  to  Everyone:
	poached hamburger is a great way to describe my code after 11pm
