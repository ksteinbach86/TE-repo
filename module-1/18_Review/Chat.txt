	As regex was not part of the reading I cannot imagine how anyone would understand how to escape a vertical bar in a Regex without knowing it beforehand.
09:29:09 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	Regex, similar to SQL, is a language agnostic sub-topic of computer coding.  You can use Regular Expressions in most if not all programming languages, usually entered in as a String literal (in Java that would be the green stuff in-between the double quotes). For the curious:		https://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html
09:29:51 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	Big picture: Regular expressions allow you to parse, validate, search, and customize String input in literally every imaginable sense.

11:01:29 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	Semantic satiation is a psychological phenomenon in which repetition causes a word or phrase to temporarily lose meaning for the listener, who then perceives the speech as repeated meaningless sounds.

11:23:07 From  Dan Shaw / Java / [He/Him]  to  Everyone:
	Question for 3:00PM:		How can the Aisle names in the folder we are looking for be duplicates?  Doesn't an operating system overwrite things automatically OR force you to change the name if its in the same folder?		And if there are no duplicates (every file will be forced to have its own unique name with the .Whatever.Whatever extension), then the Aisle list will never contain the current file we are looking at... right?		What am I missing?
